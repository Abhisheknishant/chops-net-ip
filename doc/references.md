# Chops Net IP References

- Chris Kohlhoff is a networking expert (among other expertises, including C++), creator of the Asio library and initial author of the C++ Networking Technical Standard (TS). Asio is available at https://think-async.com/ and Chris' GitHub site is https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/. Asio forms the basis for the C++ Networking Technical Standard (TS), which will be standardized in C++ 23 or C++ 26 (or thereabouts). Currently the Chops Net IP library uses the stand-alone Asio repository from Chris' GitHub account.

- Vinnie Falco is the author of the Boost Beast library, an excellent building block library for asynchronous (and synchronous) HTTP and WebSocket applications. His Beast library uses Asio. He is proficient in C++ including presenting at CppCon and is also active in blockchain development and other technology areas. His GitHub site is https://github.com/vinniefalco. While Chops Net IP does not depend on Beast, the choices and design rationale made by Vinnie in implementing Beast are highly helpful.

- Phil Nash is the author of the Catch C++ unit testing library. The Catch library is available at https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.

- The Boost libraries collection is a high quality set of C++ libraries, available at https://www.boost.org/.

- Kirk Shoop is a C++ expert, particularly in the area of asynchronous design, and has presented multiple times at CppCon. His GitHub site is https://github.com/kirkshoop.
